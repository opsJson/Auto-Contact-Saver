# Privacy Policy
The **Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web** extension respects and values the privacy of its users. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you use our extension.

# Collection and Use of Information
The **Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web** extension is designed to convert audio received on Whatsapp into text, facilitating textual communication for users. By using our extension, we can collect and process the audio you choose to send for transcription.

We use OpenAI's Whiser API to transcribe audio into text. When you submit audio, we transmit it to the Whiser API for transcription purposes only. We do not store or retain audio submitted for transcription, nor the transcription results after they are delivered to you.

# Security and Storage
It is important to highlight that we do not store any audio sent for transcription on our servers or anywhere else. All processing is done on a temporary and transitory basis to provide the desired transcript, and the results are sent directly back to you on Whatsapp.

# Consent
By using the **Audio to Text for Whatsapp Web** extension, you expressly consent to the transmission of audio to OpenAI's Whiser API for transcription purposes, as described in this privacy policy.

# Changes to the Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time by notifying users through updates to the extension or on our website.

# Contact
If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please contact us at **cleversonpelegrini@gmail.com**
