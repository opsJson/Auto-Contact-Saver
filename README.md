After installing the extension, you will have to give permission for contacts from your Google account, the same one connected to your cell phone with Whatsapp. It's just that.

This extension automatically saves new contacts, there's no need to even leave the conversation window open.

When saving, an hourglass icon (âŒ›) will be at the end of the name, signaling that everything went well, and you only have to wait up to 5 minutes for Google to send the contact to your cell phone.
